# LINUX SYSTEM FILE STRUCTURE

/bin /usr/bin - executables, files necessary to boot up the system
/sbin /usr/sbin  - files, necessary for admin user (super-user bin files)
/dev - devices 
/etc - (edeitable text configuration) all system settings
/lib - libraries, necessary for files located in /bin /sbin

/root - home directory of a superuser, home directories of all the other users
 are locateed in /home/.

/usr - (UNIX SYSTEM RESOURCES) contains all the other resources, looks like 
root directory, so, basically  it contains all the res, which won't be 
modified (media, docs, etc). Takes up the most space 

/var - contains variable files, which are changed during the work of the
system. e.g. /var/log - contains logs files of errors

/home - home directory
/media - entry points of portable devices connected to the laptop

/mnt - entry points for connecting SSD , hard drives, etc
/opt - optional packages for apps (it should have contained all the
additional files, but for historical reasons they're usually are in /usr)
 
/srv -  data for public server services
/tmp - stores temporary files, which would be erased after the shutdown
/proc /sys - virtual file systems are mounted here 
/boot - files of boot manager, kernel is stored here
